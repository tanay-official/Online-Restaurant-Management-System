An Online restaurant management system involves placing online food from a website. The goal of an online restaurant management project is to design a computerized order-taking system to replace the current method. Since MYSQL Server serves as the backend for online restaurant management, there is no risk of data loss or security issues. The client may learn about the food's quality, how long it takes to prepare, and when it's available from the website.
